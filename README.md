# Analog Circuits Lab

## EE 230 - Spring Semester 2022

## Course Instructor - Prof. Anil Kottantharayil 

This repository contains all the netlists, plots, reports for all the various circuits simulated using [NGSPICE](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/).


Towards the later half of the course, the labs were conducted offline at [Wadhwani Electronics Lab, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~wel_iitb/) and the circuits were assembled on breadboards and the readings were obtained using instruments such as DMMs, DSOs and AFGs. The reports for these offline labs can also be found here.
